"You two are the main candidates for being the fourth member on the A team."	

I still have the email. I had just finished freshman year, and I had a chance of playing on quizbowl A team, which was ranked 4th in the nation!

A few months (and a lot of studying) later, I was off to the collegiate-level ACF Fall tournament at the University of Florida. I was playing with 3 experienced seniors who had picked me to be their fourth player. I was full of doubts. Did I really deserve my spot? What if I let down the team?

We started the first round. "Watch out," whispered my teammate. "That school's got a really good science player." I was terrified.

Most of the questions flew past me. Suddenly, though, I heard a science question. I knew this! I quickly buzzed, then answered the question. I then breathed a sigh of relief. At least I got one question right! In fact, our momentum that round carried us to a resounding win.

And then my confidence rose.

By the end of the tournament, I had almost surpassed the second scorer on the team. I had exceeded the seniors' expectations and earned their respect. And I had gained confidence in myself. Since then, my career in quizbowl has skyrocketed.

More importantly, though, is the mindset with which I achieved the tournament. I learned to not worry about my inexperience, not let my doubts overpower me, but live in the present. No matter how daunting a task seems, I can do it as long as I focus on the task at hand. Whenever I feel a twinge of doubt, all I need to do is remember my first ACF Fall tournament to bring me confidence.
