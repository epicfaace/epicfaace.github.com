Stanford students possess an intellectual vitality. Reflect on an idea or experience that has been important to your intellectual development. (100 to 250 words)

It is the finals at a national quizbowl tournament. As our team's science specialist, I answer a question on mitosis. Then quantum tunneling. Dwarf planets. But then I get a tossup on Zoroastrianism. Then Odin. The Kalevala. Bertrand Russell. Arthur Schopenhauer. Evidently, I am not just a science player! In fact, I am also a specialist in RMP (religion, mythology, philosophy) and music. 

Quizbowl has given me a more informed perspective on the world. Before quizbowl, I had never even heard of much philosophy beyond Aristotle and Plato. Neither did I know about religions other than my own. Now, I am genuinely interested in works such as The Republic, thinkers such as Kant, and stories from the Bible and the Classics. What started as a desire to beat other teams has turned into a genuine interest in topics ranging from philosophy to international politics. This experience has given me a valuable array of perspectives with which to view the world. And no other college values the necessity of multiple viewpoints, both from STEM and the liberal arts, better than Stanford.

Additionally, quizbowl has encouraged me to look beyond school and push myself to the limit. Every tossup in quizbowl is structured as a paragraph; even when I get a question right, there is still a multitude of clues I don't know. Essentially, it has taught me that learning is fun â€“ and that there is truly no limit. It is my desire to challenge myself that has led me to exhaust the most difficult APs at school, and now to take sophomore- and junior-level college classes at Georgia Tech. Why else would I take classes from organic chemistry to quantum physics? It is because I love to learn.
