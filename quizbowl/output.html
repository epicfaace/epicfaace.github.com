When used with antimony trifluoride to treat chloroform, Teflon is created. This chemical is prepared by reacting its anion's namesake mineral with sulfuric acid, or as a byproduct in the creation of phosphoric acid. It does not completely dissociate in water, so it penetrates skin very easily, reacting with calcium to dissolve bone.

FTP, name this type of intermolecular bond that is responsible for the extremely high boiling point of water, an extremely strong type of dipole-dipole forces."},
	{term:"hydrochloric acid [or aqueous hydrogen chloride; or muriatic acid; accept HCl before mention; prompt on spirits of salt]",def:"This chemical is a byproduct in a process to extract magnesium from serpentine mine tailings developed by the Magnola company. Caution must be employed when applying potassium permanganate stains to TLC plates that might contain this compound to avoid releasing toxic gas. This compound twice cleaves a carbon-zinc bond in the mechanism of the (*) Clemmensen reduction, and it is regenerated using pyrohydrolysis from its industrial use as a pickling agent for steel. This compound's limited propensity for redox chemistry leads it to be mixed with nitric acid to form aqua regia.

	{term:"sodium bicarbonate (accept sodium hydrogen carbonate or baking soda or NaHCO3 before read; do not accept or prompt \"sodium carbonate\" or \"baking powder\")",def:"This compound is found naturally in minerals such as nahcolite, and it precipitates out of a reaction between carbon dioxide, water, and soda ash.
