She foiled attempts at her throne by Spanish king Philip II and Mary, Queen of Scots; the latter -- reluctantly executed in 1587. Her reign saw great expansion of the English navy and the emergence of William Shakespeare. but when she died, the Crown went to Scottish king James VI, the son of Mary, Queen of Scots."},

An able administrator, he authorized a survey of his kingdom in the 1086 Domesday Book. had replaced Anglo-Saxon nobles and clergy with Normans and other continentals."},
	{term:"Charles I",def:"The last absolute English monarch, -- ran into trouble almost immediately. His minister, the Duke of Buckingham, asked Parliament for money to fight costly foreign wars, and when Parliament balked, --- had to sign the Petition of Right. From 1630 to 1641 he tried to rule solo, but financial troubles forced him to call the Short and Long Parliaments. His attempt to reform the Scottish Church was the last straw, as Parliament entered into the English Civil War; they defeated --, convicting him of treason and executing him. England became a Commonwealth with Oliver Cromwell as Lord Protector."},

As the great-great-grandson of Henry VII, he claimed the English throne upon the death of Elizabeth I. -- was the intended target of Catholic fanatic Guy Fawkes' failed Gunpowder Plot in 1605.

Tolerant of Catholics, he dissolved Parliament over the issue in 1681 and refused to prevent his brother James from succeeding him."},
	{term:"James II",def:"The 1678 Popish Plot against Charles II would have elevated the Roman Catholic -- to the throne, had it been real and not fabricated by Titus Oates. --'s three years, however, did feature heavy favoritism toward Catholics, so much so that Protestants invited --'s son-in-law William of Orange to rule England, deposing -- in the bloodless Glorious Revolution.

	{term:"Louis XIII",def:"Sometimes working with his chief minister, Cardinal Richelieu, and sometimes against, -- turned France into the pre-eminent European power during his reign; this was largely achieved via French victories in the Thirty Years' War. The Three Musketeers is set in the early years of his reign."},
	{term:"Francis I",def:"--'s early military victories (like the Battle of Marignano), his lavish court, and his support of luminaries like Leonardo da Vinci augured a splendid reign. His rivalry with Charles V of the Holy Roman Empire spelled his doom. He was captured in battle in 1525 and held for a humiliating ransom; wars continued after his release, but bankruptcy and religious strife laid France low."},
	{term:"Henry IV",def:"Founder of the house of Bourbon. --, the king of Navarre, became the heir to the throne when Henry III's brother died in 1584.

	{term:"Charles VIII",def:"--'s short reign is remarkable for the enormous cost in men and money of his Italian campaign but more so for the number of his successors that to followed his catastrophic lead. -- was motivated by a desire to govern Naples, which he had theoretically inherited. He died before he could surpass or absolve his disastrous first campaign with another."},

	{term:"Henry III",def:"--'s reign was suffused with blood, at first because of the continuous Wars of Religion that pitted Catholics against Huguenots, but later because of the struggles that arose when it became clear that he was going to be the last of the Valois line.

Scholars differ on whether -- was literate and on how auspiciously his reign began. Early in his reign, he pushed through a series of well-received reforms and called a zemskii sobor (or \"assembly of the land\"). But -- had an amazingly cruel streak and eventually became unstable: he temporarily abdicated in 1564, killed his favorite son, created a state-within-the-state called the oprichnina to wage war on the boyars, and participated in the torture of his enemies. -- combined the absolutist tendencies of his predecessors with his own violent personality, helping to plunge the country into the subsequent period of civil strife known as the \"Time of Troubles\"."},

	{term:"Alexander II",def:"-- embarked on a program of Great Reforms soon after taking the throne near the end of the Crimean War.

He is best known for his wars with Napoleon (first as an ally and then as an enemy), and for seeking to establish a Holy Alliance in the years that followed. -- was an eccentric and a religious mystic; some even say that he didn't really die in 1825: instead, they argue, he faked his own death, became a hermit, and died in a monastery in 1864."},
	{term:"Nicholas I",def:"--, who ruled Russia from the failure of the Decembrist Uprising to the middle of the Crimean War, has traditionally been portrayed as the embodiment of the Russian autocracy. His government pursued a policy of Official Nationality, defending a holy trinity of \"Autocracy, Orthodoxy, and Nationality,\" and established a repressive secret police force known as the Third Section.

	{term:"Alexander III",def:"Those who hoped that the assassination of Alexander II would lead to liberalization saw the error of their ways when the new tsar, --, launched his program of \"counter-reforms\". Under him, the state enacted a series of Temporary Regulations (giving it the power to crack down on terrorism), increased censorship, tightened controls on Russia's universities, created a position of \"land captain\" to exert state control in the countryside, and either encouraged or ignored the first anti-Jewish pogroms."},
	{term:"Boris Godunov",def:"-- began his career as a boyar in Ivan the Terrible's oprichnina, and eventually became tsar himself. -- first cemented his influence by marrying a daughter of one of Ivan's court favorites and arranging his sister Irina's marriage to Ivan's son Fyodor; then he became regent under Fyodor, and was elected tsar when Fyodor died in 1598.
